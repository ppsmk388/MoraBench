[How Many Validation Labels Do You Need? Exploring the Design Space of Label-Efficient Model Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01619).

LEMR is a novel framework that minimizes the need for costly annotations in model selection by strategically annotating instances from an unlabeled validation set.

This is the framework of our LEMR:
